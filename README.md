# k

> k is the new l, yo

Adds new features to standard `ls` (or more closely the alias `ls -la`) in zsh like color coded permissions and dirty checking git repos so you can see at a glance which are clean and which are dirty across a whole folder full of repos.

### how to use
Put `k.sh` somewhere, and source it in your `.zshrc`.

```bash
source ~/path-to/k/k.sh
```

hit k, just like you would l (or ls)

```bash
k
```

Profit.
