# k

> k is the new l, yo

Adds new features to standard `ls` (or more closely the alias `ls -la`) for zsh.
* Color coded permissions.
* Git dirty checking.

### Installation
Put `k.sh` somewhere, and source it in your `.zshrc`.

```bash
source ~/path-to/k/k.sh
```

### Usage
hit k, just like you would l (or ls)

```bash
k
```

Profit.
